# Glottography: Supporting Material

Supporting material for the publication "Glottography: an open-source geolinguistic data platform for mapping the world’s languages," including a script to reproduce the analyses. The script downloads the following data from online repositories:

- **Glottography:** all currently available datasets containing language polygons.  
- **Glottolog:** all languages with point coordinates and language families, including all known members classified as languages.  
- **Natural Earth:** land, ocean, lakes, cities, and rivers from Natural Earth Data.

Note that the Ethnologue language polygons used for comparison are subject to third-party licensing restrictions and cannot be publicly shared.  
Please ensure that all listed dependencies are installed.
